The Python/R code assumes the data is installed to a "C:\datasets" folder with no subdirectory. You can either change this in the code or temporarily create the directory yourself (which is probably easier, as the data is reimported in various steps).

I will also try to host these files on github during the marking period at https://github.com/wbreedon/Oil-shock-modelling. 

There are 11 data files:
-POILBREUSDM is the original oil price data from the Federal Reserve. POILBREUSDM2-9 are modified versions of this dataset that have been cleaned and have additional variables applied to them. Of note is POILBREUSDM8, which contains the explanations of what geopolitical events applied as exogeneous.
-FEDFUNDS is the original dataset of interest rates from the Federal Reserve. FEDFUNDS2 is a version with additional cleaning.
-GDPC1 contains the monthly GDP data from IHS Mariott.
